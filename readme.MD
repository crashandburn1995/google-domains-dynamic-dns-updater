# Update Google Dynamic DNS Script
This script updates a Google Dynamic DNS record for a domain from Google Domains.

I created this script to run on my Unifi Dream Router, but it will work on any platform that can run Python 3.

## How to use
Replace the `username`, `password` and `hostname` values with:
- Username -> The username in the `view credentials` window in Google Domains Dynamic DNS.
- Password -> The password in the `view credentials` window in Google Domains Dynamic DNS.
- Hostname -> The host name for the Dynamic DNS entry.
